# Project-On-Ecommerce
I made an E-commerce project, explaining the sector and its website tools like CSS system. I used Woo Commerce and Shopify, and built a website using Shopify. It had products, categories, a theme, and a landing page etc. From this project I learned how to run an E-commerce website in a well managed format.
